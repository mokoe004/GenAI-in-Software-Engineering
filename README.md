# GenAI-in-Software-Engineering

The goal is to develop a software-based visual configurator which simulates and visualizes the implementation of CoPilot. This simulator should represent the interplay of critical success factors along a roadmap including milestones of AI implementation in a user friendly way while referring explicitly to CoPilot in software development and engineering.

```bash
pip install dash pandas
```
